# act

Inspired by [do](https://github.com/metarhia/do)

This library was born as an attempt to eliminate some of the shortcomings of the `do` library

What's wrong with `do`:
1) It supports chaining, but doesn't support reusable blocks of chain
2) Doesn't support passing data along the chain
3) Direct Access only to the last error and last result
